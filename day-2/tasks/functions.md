# What is a function?

# Define your own functions

## Calculate the GC content of a genome

All you know is the sequence length (349 bp) and the count of Gs in the sequence (182)

**What do you need to do?**

## But what if you have several genomes for which you would do this calculation?

sequence lengths: 349, 502, 829, 185, 420

G counts:         182, 328, 392, 101, 173

**one calculation for every data pair**

**for loop**

**with a self defined function**
